# **RFM Analysis & Automation ðŸ“ŠðŸš€**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project automates **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) Analysis** to segment clients based on their trading behavior. Using **SQL and Python**, the system extracts, processes, and categorizes trading data to identify high-value, dormant, and at-risk clients. Additionally, an **automated email reporting system** sends insights to department heads every **15 days**, improving decision-making and client retention strategies.  

## **Key Features**  
âœ… **Automated Data Extraction** â€“ Queries SQL databases to fetch client trading details.  
âœ… **RFM Segmentation** â€“ Categorizes clients using **percentile ranking** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).  
âœ… **Python Automation** â€“ Streamlines data processing and analysis workflows.  
âœ… **Power BI Dashboard** â€“ Visualizes key metrics and client segments for quick insights.  
âœ… **Email Automation** â€“ Sends RFM reports with attachments to department heads every **15 days**.  

## **Tech Stack**  
ðŸ”¹ **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, smtplib for email automation)  
ðŸ”¹ **SQL** (Data extraction and transformation)  
ðŸ”¹ **Power BI** (Visualization and reporting)
